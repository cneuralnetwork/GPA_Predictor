This is a fun model which will calculate your GPA for the next sem

You have to make a `.csv file` that will have details of your whole batch's marks till date in this manner
For example,

```
Name,GPA1,GPA2
Akash,8.91,9.40
Vinesh,8.72,9.12
```

Name the csv file, as `data.csv`
and then run main.py
